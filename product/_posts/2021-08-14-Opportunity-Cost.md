Charlie Munger - the famous investment partner of Warner Buffet, attributes most of his success to thinking in Mental Models.

So, I too wanted to learn some mental models and bought a book which called itself "THE BIG BOOK" of mental models with an attractive title - Super Thinking.

As I read through one mental model after another that the author tied together, one that stood out for me and felt like something which will simplify the decision making in our life is 'Opportunity Cost'. 

> Opportunity Cost is the cost of the alternative opportunity that you have missed by making your favorite choice

Any choices in life like:

 * making a big investment - buying a Plot in Aparna Western Meadows vs giving out the money for 2% interest per month
 * choosing a career - taking the Campus placement offer vs going to US for MS
 * choosing a life partner from the matrimony site - the good looking boy or girl vs someone with sound property background

...you get the idea, the goal is to make a choice that has the least opportunity cost. 

The cost need not also be just in terms of quantity like monetory value and time or effort saved. It could also be in terms of the quality that it offers to you as per your priorities. If having a worklife balance is your priority, you would choose the job with the least opportunity cost interms of the flexible working hours and peace of mind that it offers or if quality of life is your priority, you would choose a job in US/Europe inspite of getting a higher package in India.

**Opportunity cost in Product Management -**

In Product Management, thinking about Opportunity cost would help a lot in making the right choice in the below two aspects:

1. Prioritizing the Roadmap: Prioritizing is the core part of Product Management. Be it prioritizing the next feature to build which would help you achieve that Product Market Fit or finally clearing out the Technical debt which has been lying in the backlog which your dev team is suggesting you to prioritize, it all boils down to choosing the item which has the least opportunity cost and gives you the best bang for the bucks.

2. Prioritizing your tasks: PMs would always have a set of tasks which need their focus. You need time to work on identifying the next big opportunity to implement in your product while simultaneously being pulled into Production support meeting where they need your input to solve a customer's problem. By choosing to do the task which will have the least opportunity cost, you make the best use of your time. Additional mental models like Eisenhower Decision Matrix could help you in determing the tasks which are of the most importance.

Opportunity cost could thus help one in making the best use of their resources - time, money or effort by helping them think about what they could be choosing alternatively to achieve their objectives. 

I write this article on a Saturday afternoong assuming this offers the least Opportunity cost for my time compared to watching Netflix or taking an afternoon nap. Hope reading it proved to be the same for your time!
