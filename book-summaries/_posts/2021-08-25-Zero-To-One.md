After the acquisition of Paypal by Ebay, the founding team of Paypal has went on to found or invest in some of the best companies in America like Tesla, Youtube, Yelp, Pinterest to name a few.

Famously known as the 'Paypal Mafia', Peter Theil is considered as the Don of this Mafia.

His book 'Zero to One which he has co-written with Blake Masters is often regarding as one of best business books ever written for startup founders. 

This article is the short summary of my learnings from the book:

**Building 0 to 1 companies:**

There are two types of progress: Horizontal progress and vertical progress 
Horizontal progress is scaling something from 1 to 100.
Vertical progress is going from zero to 1 which is basically making something that doesn’t exist.
Technology is vertical progress. In a world of limited resources, globalization without technology progress is catastrophic. New technology comes from new ventures which are called Startups

**Contrarian Thinking:**

The most contrarian way to think is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourselves. 
1990s were the golden age of tech innovation. Mosaic browser was launched in 1993 and Netscape in 1994, Amazon IPO’ed in 1995. By the end of the decade the dotcom Mania happened which is between September 1998 to March 2000 and then the bubble burst. The stock market went from 5000 points in March 2000 to 3000 points in April 2002 and 1000 points in October 2002.

Due to the impact of the bubble pop, everybody in Silicon Valley went back from believing in technology to believing in globalisation.

The rules that everybody started following are :
1.	Take small and incremental steps
2.	Stay lean and flexible
3.	Improve on the competition 
4.	Focus on the product but not on sales – only sustainable growth is viral growth

They could not be more wrong. To create great companies:
1.	We should be taking bold steps instead of just small incremental progress
2.	A bad plan is better than no plan at all 
3.	Competition destroys profits
4.	Sales matter as much as the product

**All Happy Companies are different:**

Each successful business earns monopoly by solving a Unique problem.
Monopoly is not a pathology. It enables companies to become successful and innovate new technologies which make the world a better place. In Contrast, Competition kills businesses by eating profits of the business

**Ideology of Competition:**

The more companies compete, the more they loose. Google and Microsoft thrived independently building successful products like Search Engine and Windows OS respectively. But later their competition in Chrome vs IE, Docs vs Office or Windows vs Chrome OS lead to their decline giving advantage to a third player like Apple to thrive more then both of them.

War is costly business. Its better to either eliminate competition with a striking blow or lending a friendly hand instead of competing and bleeding slowly

**Characteristics of a Monopoly:**

1.	Proprietary Technology – Google
2.	Network Effect – Facebook
3.	Economics of Scale – All Software product companies
4.	Branding – Apple

Beginning with the brand rather than the substance is Dangerous. Start small and monopolize.
Don’t focus on disrupting the existing businesses as it could make you fixed on your competitors and distract you from creating value. Avoid competition as much as possible. 
Its better to be a last mover and make a significant development and enjoy the success in the following years.

**You are not a Lottery Ticket:**

Shallow men believe in Luck and Circumstances. Strong men believe in Cause and Effect.
Definite plans need to be made to achieve an optimistic future without leaving it to chance.
Apple was designed by Steve Jobs to achieve success by running Multi-year projects.
Having concreate vision and great design is key to achieve big things instead of just having Focus group discussions and listening to Feedback

**Follow the Money:**

Never underestimate the power of exponential growth. Small minority often achieve disproportional results. Follow the Pareto principle.
VC funds form only .2% of the US GDP. VCs fund only 1% of the new business startups in America. But VC funded companies make 11% of the GDP. VCs bet on the Pareto principle by trusting that 20% of their portfolio deliver the 80% results to make up for the loss of the other 80% companies that fail
Every individual should follow the Pareto principle and focus on what gives the best results.
When choosing a career, think about the returns you are going to get from the future decades. Entrepreneurs cannot diversify while choosing to start their companies. Individuals cannot diversify their careers. You can choose to join companies with expected growth instead of started your own company.

**The Mechanics of Mafia:**

Paypal team went on to found 7 other successful billion dollar companies. Paypal was not known for the Silicon valley office perks. Its because of the team culture they became so successful.
When joining a company, join for the mission of the company and the team culture instead of getting attracted by the office perks like massages or free snacks. It is very important to have a personal connection with the team and have a long term outlook with them and not be just transactional
