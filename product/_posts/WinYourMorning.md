As I wake up and slowly gain consciousness, the first thing that I would do unconsciously is to look at my phone. Part of the habit is due to my intention to find the time. But It wouldn’t let me stop there as there will be some pending notifications from either Whatsapp or Gmail waiting for me to have a look and put it back. 99% of the time those notifications will be useful. But they will trigger my next steps to checkout other apps like twitter, Instagram and even Youtube to find something to feed my brain with some cheap dopamine. And thus, starts my day of endless and brainless scroll.

If I think about it, it all happens from my initial trigger to look at the time. Displaying Time must be the single most important feature in smart phones that has contributed to their adoption. As people look at mobile phones to know the time (in-spite of having a wristwatch), the phones “Lure” the users by showing pending notifications from various apps making the user to take an action to clear them. 

As people say – ‘Winning the morning helps you Win the Day’ and most of the days, my mobile phone is what used to make me lose my mornings.

**4 Steps to avoid this habit:**
1.	**Prepare a To Do list for the next day:** Planning your next day before you go to bed will reduce friction to your brain early morning in deciding what to do after you wake up. This will help you avoid wasting time in the morning and focus on the pre-planned Productive tasks 
2.	**Bed time habits:** Go to bed early to have enough sleep for the night and try to switch off screens at least 1 hour before the bed time. I know they are easier said than done in our busy calenders but doing it will help you be more productive during the day by giving you enough rest. I often noticed that if had slept late after watching a Netflix show, I felt worse the next morning. This would in turn make me have less will power and I end of spending time on phone doing doom scrolling
3.	**Plan to do something you love immediately after you wake up:** I love reading books and I always plan to read an interesting book after I wake up and before I get on with my regular day. Scheduling time to pursue your favorite hobby keeps you motivated in the morning
4.	**Keep your phone out of your reach:** If it can’t reach you, then it can’t hurt you! Keep your phone in the hall before you go to sleep, so that it can’t bother you with the notifications and make you open it. Well How do I check the Time? You ask, buy a table clock. They are much cheaper than your time and are easily available on Amazon

Knowledge is knowing the information, but Wisdom is using it for our benefit. Knowing the steps to take and choosing to follow them everyday are two separate things. We win on somedays and we lose to our own laziness on other days. Without regretting the loses, I try to follow the routine to score a Win in the morning on most days.
