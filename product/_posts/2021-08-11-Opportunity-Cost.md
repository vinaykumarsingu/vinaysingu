Charlie Munger - the famous investment partner of Warner Buffet, attributes most of his success to thinking in Mental Models.

So, I too wanted to learn some mental models and bought a book which called itself "THE BIG BOOK" of mental models with an attractive title - Super Thinking.

As I read through one mental model after another that the author tied together, one mental model which stood out for me and felt like something which will simplify the decision making in our life is 'Opportunity Cost'. Opportunity Cost is the cost of the option that you will miss by choosing whatever that you have chosen. Any choices in life from making a big investment -Buying a Plot in Aparna westfields vs giving out the money for 2% interest, choosing a career - taking the Campus placement offer vs going to US for MS, choosing a life partner from matrimony site- the good looking boy or girl vs someone with good property background...you got the idea, the goal is to make a choice that has the least opportunity cost. 

The cost need not be just interms of monetory value. It could be interms of the value that it offers to you as per your priorities. If you having a worklife balance is your priority, you would choose the job with least opportunity cost interms of the flexible working hours and peace of mind that it offers and if quality of life is your priority, you would choose a job in US/Europe inspite of getting a higher package in India.

Opportunity cost in Product Management -

Prioritizing the Roadmap: Prioritizing is the core part of Product Management. Be it prioritizing the next feature to build which would help you achieve that Product Market Fit or finally clearing out the Technical debt which has been lying in the backlog which your dev team is suggesting you to prioritize, it all boils down to choosing the item which has the least opportunity cost and gives you best bang for the bucks.

Prioritizing your tasks: PMs would always have a set of tasks which need your focus. You need time to work on identifying the next biggest opportunity to implement in your product while simultaneously being pulled into Production support meeting where they need your input to solve a customer's problem.
